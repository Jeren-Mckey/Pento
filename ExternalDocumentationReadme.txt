1) I can't see the login button becasue the keyboard is covering it?

You can press the check mark to enter your username and password and then press the sign in button, or press the android back button and then the sign in button.

2) How do I register as a new user?

3)What does the profile screen show?

The profile screen first shows the groups you are in on top, then gives a search bar that allows you to search for groups. The bottom box i the groups returned by the search.

4) The search bar is not working

The search bar looks up groups by interest and is case sensitive. If there are not any groups of that interest, it will not return anything. 

5) My group is not showing up but I know it exists.

The search bar is case sensitive, so your group may not be showing up.
