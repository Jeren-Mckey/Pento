# What is Pento?

Pento is an android messaging app that conencts people around each other using the things they all love to do. 
The primary function of this app is to take a an interest, like basketball or video games, and match together
5 different users who all share that interest into a chat room. The app relies on location data from the user and attempts 
to match users who are closest together. Their is private messaging functionality but group chatting is what is encouraged.
The chat is meant to be informal; people can leave or enter groups as they see fit. Pento seeks to help people find meaningful
connections. Current development on hold.
